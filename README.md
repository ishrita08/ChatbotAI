# ChatbotAI
This is a chatbot that was developed for the Georgia Tech class CSC-7637 Knowledge Based AI.

How it works?
The user will ask the chatbot a question, the chatbot either provides an answer or asks the user for more information. The chatbot should learn while interacting with the user to provide better answers the more the chatbot is used.

The code in this project was created from a template found at https://github.com/egregori3/ChatBotTester
